Inspiration

The truly inspiring campus ducks. Legends.
What it does

A-pecks Legends is an online multiplayer hero shooter game, but the contenders are ducks. These feathered fighters leave in a dangerous world, the University of Bath campus, and they are out for your bread. Battle for glory, fame and baked goods in A-pecks Legends.
How we built it

We built the game in Unity game engine. Additionally, we used the Unity Netcode library to allow us to implement the online multiplayer functionality (albeit with great suffering). This was in conjunction with the Relay cloud service to facilitate lobby-based matchmaking. All custom-made sprites were created in Aseprite.
Challenges we ran into

None, it was perfect. We are legends. We definitely did not have major issues including but not limited to:

    Major version control nightmares
    Network object permissions issues
    Physics collision issues
    Sound clip issues
    UI layout issues

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Managing to create a (mostly) functional multiplayer game in 24 hours, despite this being a new challenge. It may not be a AAA title or anywhere near, but as far as we're concerned, it definitely is entertaining!
What we learned

To never try to create a functional online multiplayer game in 24 hours, especially if this is a new challenge.
What's next for A-pecks Legends

Let the battle of the ducks commence!
